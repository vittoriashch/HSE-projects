Welcome to my repository, where I explore distinct projects in the field of data analysis and machine learning.

## Projects Overview
### [Financial Data Analysis and Optimal Portfolio Compounding](https://github.com/vittoriashch/HSE-projects/blob/main/Noisy%20Data%20ML%20HW.ipynb)

This project focuses on analyzing financial data to tackle the optimal portfolio compounding problem. It involves examining various financial metrics and implementing algorithms to optimize investment strategies.

*Key Topics: Financial metrics, Portfolio optimization, Compounding effects, Data Analysis*

### **[Processing Noisy Bicycle Rental Data and Machine Learning Application](https://github.com/vittoriashch/HSE-projects/blob/main/Noisy%20Data%20ML%20HW.ipynb)**
In this project, I address the challenges of working with noisy data from bicycle rentals. The goal is to preprocess the data effectively and apply machine learning techniques to uncover rental patterns and make predictions.

*Key Topics: Data preprocessing, Machine learning methods, Rental pattern analysis*

### **[Taxi Orders Analysis and Trip Duration Optimization](https://github.com/vittoriashch/HSE-projects/blob/main/Taxi_Orders_HW.ipynb)**
This project focuses on analyzing taxi order data with the primary goal of optimizing trip duration. It involves examining various metrics related to taxi orders, including factors affecting trip length, and implementing algorithms to enhance efficiency in trip management.

*Key Topics: Data preprocessing, Geographic data analysis, Feature engineering*

### **[Decision Trees: Classification, Custom Implementation, and Model Trees](https://github.com/vittoriashch/HSE-projects/blob/main/decision_trees.ipynb)**

This project is divided into three parts:

In the first part, I explore decision trees using scikit-learn for classification tasks. I visualize the decision boundaries produced on different datasets and analyze how they change with various hyperparameters.

In the second part, I implement a custom decision tree classifier from scratch and compare its performance with the standard scikit-learn implementation.

In the third part, I develop a regression tree where each leaf contains a linear regression model, allowing for more flexible predictions.

*Key Topics: Decision trees, Custom ML implementation, Model interpretability, Regression trees with linear models*

### **[Logistic Regression, SVMs, Feature Engineering, and Model Calibration](https://github.com/vittoriashch/HSE-projects/blob/main/vischudro_homework_practice_04_linclass.ipynb))**

In this project, I explore the internal mechanics of logistic regression and support vector machines (SVMs), apply probability calibration techniques, experiment with variable transformations and feature selection, and assess the economic impact of model decisions in a business context.

*Key Topics: Logistic regression, SVMs, Feature selection, Probability calibration, Economic impact evaluation*

### **[Custom Gradient Descent for Linear Regression](https://github.com/vittoriashch/HSE-projects/blob/main/gradient_descent.ipynb)**

This project focuses on implementing custom gradient descent algorithms to optimize linear regression models. It includes detailed mathematical derivations of the optimization steps and a comparison of different variants of gradient descent in terms of convergence and performance.

**Key Topics: Gradient descent, Linear regression, Optimization algorithms, Mathematical derivations**
