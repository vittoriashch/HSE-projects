Welcome to my repository, where I explore two distinct projects in the field of data analysis and machine learning.

## Projects Overview
### [Financial Data Analysis and Optimal Portfolio Compounding] (https://github.com/vittoriashch/HSE-projects/blob/main/Noisy%20Data%20ML%20HW.ipynb)

This project focuses on analyzing financial data to tackle the optimal portfolio compounding problem. It involves examining various financial metrics and implementing algorithms to optimize investment strategies.

Key Topics: Financial metrics, Portfolio optimization, Compounding effects, Data Analysis

## **[Processing Noisy Bicycle Rental Data and Machine Learning Application](Noisy Data ML HW.ipynb)**
In this project, I address the challenges of working with noisy data from bicycle rentals. The goal is to preprocess the data effectively and apply machine learning techniques to uncover rental patterns and make predictions.

Key Topics: Data preprocessing, Machine learning methods, Rental pattern analysis
